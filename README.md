# ams (another movie search)

TMBD search app

- It was created in about three days of work, so UI is not perfect.

- It was created using Yeoman’s scaffolding. I didn’t want to start
from scratch and that generator works of for me.

- The app is not using require.js, yeoman doesn’t have a generator for
that. I was looking at how to implement that but time was not enough.

- There are a lot of improvements that needs to be done: A deploy
task, automatically tests and code generator, but main goal was to
focus on the app and make it works.
